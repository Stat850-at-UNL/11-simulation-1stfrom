# Instructor Comments

I have scaffolded this set of instructions very carefully. 

Please proceed sequentially through this document, and do not move onto the next step until you have completed the present step.

My goal in this class is to teach you how to solve hard problems by breaking them down. 
This assignment is the culmination of that process, where you demonstrate that you have the tools to solve these hard problems. 

You WILL get confused and miss steps if you do not follow the instructions sequentially.

# Understanding the game flow

## Flowchart {#sec-flowchart}

Create a flowchart illustrating how the game unfolds, using the function names provided in the ChatGPT code. 
Include this as a PNG file in the repository and link to it here.

## Single game data structure {#sec-single-game-data}

It's one thing to write a set of instructions/pseudocode for how to *play* a game, but it's a separate task to figure out how to **computationally simulate** the game. 
For instance, in a simulation you often need to keep track of each move, and then compute summary statistics about the game to use when compiling simulation data.

Draw/sketch a tabular data structure that can store the results as you progress through a single game of craps. Keep track of how many times you've rolled the dice.
What additional columns do you need? 


| **Roll Number** | **Die 1** | **Die 2** | **Sum** | **Outcome** | **Point Established** | **Game Status** |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1               | 4         | 3         | 7       |Natural (Win)|           -     | Ended (Pass Line Win) |
| 1               | 3         | 5         | 8       |Point Established|       8     | Ongoing               |
| 2               | 1         | 3         | 4       |Roll|                    8     | Ongoing               |
| 3               | 6         | 1         | 7       |Seven-Out (Lose)|        8     | Ended                 |

## Summary data structure {#sec-game-summary-data}

Draw/sketch a summary tabular data structure to store summary information from a single game of craps.

|**Game ID**|**Total Rolls**|**Point Established**|**Final Outcome**|  **Winning Roll (Sum)**  |  **Losing Roll (Sum)**  |**Natural Wins**|**Craps Losses**|
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1           | 5               | 7                    | Pass Line Win          | 7                       | -                     | 1                | 0                |
| 2           | 8               | 5                    | Seven-Out (Loss)       | -                       | 7                     | 0                | 1                |
| 3           | 3               | -                    | Craps (Loss)           | -                       | 12                    | 0                | 1                |


# Simulating a game of craps {#sec-simulation-pseudocode}

In this part of the assignment, you'll spend the time figuring out how to implement craps as a computational simulation by adapting the ChatGPT pseudocode. 
Your code structure will be different from ChatGPT's structure because you are going to generate data to estimate various conditional probabilities.

**Requirement 1:**    
You must have a function to simulate a single craps game, `simulate_craps_game`, which returns a data frame with at least the following columns: 

- `id` (# times the dice has been rolled)
- `roll` (the total roll of the dice)
- `outcome` (win, loss, or continue)

You may have additional columns if you want.

**Requirement 2:**    
You must include a summary function named `summarize_craps_game` that takes the data frame returned by `simulate_craps_game` and generates a single row with the following columns:

- `n_rolls`, the number of times the dice were rolled in the game,
- `outcome`, whether the game was won or lost
- `point`, the total of the dice on the first roll, if the game continued past the first roll, and NA otherwise.

**Requirement 3:**    
You must include a function to run your simulation, `run_craps_simulation(N)` that takes a single integer argument `N` which determines the number of games which will be played. 

Think carefully about how you want to structure your code - do you want to return the full results for each game and then summarize, or do you want to summarize before you return the full results?


## Planning Helper Functions {#sec-helper}

Consider helper functions you will need to write to implement the game of craps. 
For each function, define the input, output, and provide a comment to explain what the function will do.

Here is pseudocode for a function that simulates the roll of the dice in craps to demonstrate the required format.

```{r, roll dice}
roll_dice <- function() {
  # Input: None
  # Output: an integer from 1 to 12
  # Description: Generate 2 random integers from 1 to 6 and sum them
  die1 <- sample(1:6, 1)
  die2 <- sample(1:6, 1)
  return(die1 + die2)
}
```


```{r, read come out roll}
come_out_outcome <- function(roll) {
  # Input: roll, integer from 2 to 12
  # Output: A string indicating "win", "lose", or "continue"
  # Description: Handles the outcome of the come-out roll  
  if (roll %in% c(7, 11)) {
    return("win")
  } else if (roll %in% c(2, 3, 12)) {
    return("loss")
  } else {
    return("point")
  }
}
```

```{r, point roll}
point_phase <- function(point) {
  # Input: point, integer representing the point number
  # Output: A string indicating "win" or "lose"
  # Description: Simulates rolling to match the point to win or hit a 7 to lose
  repeat {
    roll <- roll_dice()
    if (roll == point) {
      return("win")
    } else if (roll == 7) {
      return("loss")
    }
  }
}
```

## Planning Main Functions {#sec-main-function-diagram}

Update your flowchart from @sec-flowchart to match the requirements of this section. 
Your flowchart should have separate blocks for each function. 
Which helper function(s) will be called inside each required function?



![Flowchart for the crap logic with function](figure/Flow_func.png)

## Simulating a full game {#sec-game-pseudocode}

Fill in the pseudocode below to specify how you would return the single game data structure you created in @sec-single-game-data above. 
Remember to fill in the input parameter inside the function definition as well as the comment.

```{r, main function}
simulate_craps_game <- function() {
  # Input: None
  # Output: Data frame with columns id, roll, outcome, point
  # Description: Simulate a single game of Craps, recording each roll and outcome
  game_log <- data.frame(id = integer(), roll = integer(), outcome = character(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  roll_count <- 1
  first_roll <- roll_dice()
  outcome <- come_out_outcome(first_roll)
  
  game_log <- rbind(game_log, data.frame(id = roll_count, roll = first_roll, outcome = outcome))
  
  if (outcome == "point") {
    point <- first_roll
    repeat {
      roll_count <- roll_count + 1
      new_roll <- roll_dice()
      outcome <- ifelse(new_roll == point, "win", ifelse(new_roll == 7, "loss", "continue"))
      game_log <- rbind(game_log, data.frame(id = roll_count, roll = new_roll, outcome = outcome))
      if (outcome %in% c("win", "loss")) {
        break
      }
    }
  }
  
  return(game_log)
}
```

## Summarizing a game {#sec-game-summary-pseudocode}

Add a function that summarizes a game of craps (e.g. go from the data structure in @sec-single-game-data to the data structure in @sec-game-summary-data).


```{r, summarize}
summarize_craps_game <- function(game_log) {
  # Input: Data frame from simulate_craps_game
  # Output: Data frame with summary of n_rolls, outcome, point
  # Description: Summarize a single game's results
  n_rolls <- nrow(game_log)
  final_outcome <- tail(game_log$outcome, 1)
  point <- ifelse(game_log$outcome[1] == "point", game_log$roll[1], NA)
  
  summary <- data.frame(n_rolls = n_rolls, outcome = final_outcome, point = point, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  return(summary)
}
```

## Simulating many games {#sec-game-simulation-pseudocode}

```{r, run simulation}
run_craps_simulation <- function(N) {
  # Input: an integer N which decide the number of games to simulate
  # Output: Data frame summarizing each game
  # Description: Runs N simulations of Craps games and summarizes results
  results <- data.frame(n_rolls = integer(), outcome = character(), point = integer(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  
  for (i in 1:N) {
    game_log <- simulate_craps_game()
    game_summary <- summarize_craps_game(game_log)
    results <- rbind(results, game_summary)
  }
  
  return(results)
}
```

```{r, run simulation example}
set.seed(114514)
simulation_results <- run_craps_simulation(10000)
head(simulation_results)
```
## Planning for implementation

What parts are still missing for you to write code implementing craps based on your pseudocode? 
What do you expect you will need to do before/during the coding process?
Make a plan for next week's work. Where will you start?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
N <- 10
results <- run_craps_simulation(N)

# no NA
wins_with_point <- results %>%
  filter(outcome == "win" & !is.na(point))

# Plot the pmf of wins with point
ggplot(wins_with_point, aes(x = factor(point))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop.., group = 1), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "pmf of wins with point",
       x = "Point",
       y = "Probability") +
  theme_minimal()
```
